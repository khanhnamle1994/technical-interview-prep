// Your friend is typing his name into a keyboard.  Sometimes, when typing a character c, the key might get long pressed, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.

// You examine the typed characters of the keyboard.  Return True if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.

/* Example 1:
Input: name = "alex", typed = "aaleex"
Output: true
Explanation: 'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.

Example 2:
Input: name = "saeed", typed = "ssaaedd"
Output: false
Explanation: 'e' must have been pressed twice, but it wasn't in the typed output.

Example 3:
Input: name = "leelee", typed = "lleeelee"
Output: true

Example 4:
Input: name = "laiden", typed = "laiden"
Output: true
Explanation: It's not necessary to long press any character. */
