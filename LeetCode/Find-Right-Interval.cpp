// Given a set of intervals, for each of the interval i, check if there exists an interval j whose start point is bigger than or equal to the end point of the interval i, which can be called that j is on the "right" of i.

// For any interval i, you need to store the minimum interval j's index, which means that the interval j has the minimum start point to build the "right" relationship for interval i. If the interval j doesn't exist, store -1 for the interval i. Finally, you need output the stored value of each interval as an array.

/* Example 1:
Input: [ [1,2] ]
Output: [-1]
Explanation: There is only one interval in the collection, so it outputs -1.

Example 2:
Input: [ [3,4], [2,3], [1,2] ]
Output: [-1, 0, 1]
Explanation: There is no satisfied "right" interval for [3,4].
For [2,3], the interval [3,4] has minimum-"right" start point;
For [1,2], the interval [2,3] has minimum-"right" start point.

Example 3:
Input: [ [1,4], [2,3], [3,4] ]
Output: [-1, 2, -1]
Explanation: There is no satisfied "right" interval for [1,4] and [3,4].
For [2,3], the interval [3,4] has minimum-"right" start point. */
